- Blog/Post view page

##### Blog/Post list page
- This page shows a paginated list of the posts/blogs created

##### Blog/Post view page
- This page displays the content of the post or blog item clicked on in the blog list page

#### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

##### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

##### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.


The app is live on [heroku](https://pushengage-frontend.herokuapp.com/)
